JDBC
API's is that gives access virtually of any tabular data source 
from the java programing language

The Java application calls JDBC classes and interfaces to submit SQL statements and retrieve results
he JDBC API is implemented through the JDBC driver

-->There are 4 types of JDBC drivers
    Type-1 driver or JDBC-ODBC bridge driver.
    Type-2 driver or Native-API driver.
    Type-3 driver or Network Protocol driver.
    Type-4 driver or Thin driver.
    
    Type-1
    JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses ODBC driver to connect to the database. 
    The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls.
    The driver is also called Universal driver because it can be used to connect to any of the databases.
