Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) offers a way to 
visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram
– Any activities (jobs)
– Individual components of the system
• And how they can interact with other software components.
– How the system will run
– How entities interact with others (components and interfaces)
– External user interface


1) USE CASE DIAGRAM

The purpose of a use case diagram in UML is to demonstrate the 
different ways that a user might interact with a system.


2) Class Diagram

Class diagram is a static diagram. It represents the static view of an application.
Class diagram is not only used for visualizing, describing, and documenting different 
aspects of a system but also for constructing executable code of the software application

3) Collaboration Diagram

A Collaboration defines a set of participants and relationships that are meaningful for
a given set of purposes

4) Sequence Diagram

Sequence Diagrams are interaction diagrams that detail how operations are carried out

5)State Diagram

Statechart diagram describes the flow of control from one state to another state

6)Component Diagram

Component diagrams are used to visualize the organization of system components
and the dependency relationships between them. They provide a high-level view 
of the components within a system.

7)Deployment Diagram

How will the software be deployed in a project 
like Waterfall method
